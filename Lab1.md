## 1. Installing VS Code
For many people taking this class, your professor may have already made you use VS Code for your previous classes, but it is still
good to learn.

Steps:
1. Use this [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to be able to download VS Code onto your computer. Make sure to download the right
one if you are on Windows or MacOS respectively.
2. Once you press the download button and it is finished updating, click on the download and begin to set up vs code using the directions
given
3. After doing all the steps required in downloading VS Code, your interface should look something like this:
